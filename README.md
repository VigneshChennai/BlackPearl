# BlackPearl
Highly scalable python wsgi application server built on top of uwsgi and nginx.
The main aim is to build an enterprise grade application server for python
webapplications by providing both the Webapplication framework and Server
component with much focus on scalability.

Currently in heavy development.
BlackPearl is functional and can be used but not ready for realtime.

    "Free software" means software that respects users' freedom and community.
    Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute,
    study, change and improve the software. Thus, "free software" is a matter
    of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of
    "free" as in "free speech," not as in "free beer".

### I believe

* Free software isn't an excuse for less quality and incomplete software.
* Fast and light weight isn't an excuse for less functionality software.
* User friendly isn't an excuse for software with lesser options.

I don't like asking excuses
but I am in need of help to make the BlackPearl a best Application server for python.
